## What does this do?

It's a Ruby gem for accessing lyrics and explanations on
[Rap Genius](http://rapgenius.com). 

They very sadly [don't have an API](https://twitter.com/RapGenius/status/245057326321655808) so I decided to replicate one for myself
with a nice bit of screen scraping with [Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri), much like my [amex](https://github.com/timrogers/amex), [ucas](https://github.com/timrogers/ucas) and [lloydstsb](https://github.com/timrogers/lloydstsb) gems.

## Installation

Install the gem, and you're ready to go. Simply add the following to your
Gemfile:

`gem "rapgenius", "~> 0.1.0"`

## Usage

Songs on Rap Genius don't have numeric identifiers as far as I can tell - they're identified by a URL slug featuring the artist and song name, for instance "Big-sean-control-lyrics". We use this to fetch a particular track, like so:

```ruby
require 'rapgenius'
song = RapGenius::Song.find("Big-sean-control-lyrics")
```

Once you've got the song, you can easily load details about it. This uses
Nokogiri to fetch the song's page and then parse it:

```ruby
song.title
# => "Control"

song.artist
# => "Big Sean"

song.full_artist
# => "Big Sean (Ft. Jay Electronica & Kendrick Lamar)"

song.images
# => ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1376434983_jay-electronica.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1375029260_Big%20Sean.png", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Kendrick-Lamar-1024x680.jpg"]

song.description
# => "The non-album cut from Sean that basically blew up the Internet due to a world-beating verse by Kendrick Lamar...
```

The `#annotations` accessor on a Song returns an array of RapGenius::Annotation
objects corresponding to different annotated lines of the song, identified by
their `id`.

You can look these up manually using `RapGenius::Annotation.find("id")`. You
can grab the ID for a lyric from a RapGenius page by right clicking on an annotation, copying the shortcut and then finding the number after "http://rapgenius.com".

```ruby
song.annotations
# => [<RapGenius::Annotation>, <RapGenius::Annotation>...]

annotation = song.annotations[99]

annotation.lyric
# => "And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale\nPusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake\nBig Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller"

annotation.explanation
# => "Kendrick calls out some of the biggest names in present day Hip-hop...""

annotation.song == song # You can get back to the song from the annotation...
# => true

annotation.id
# => "2093001"

annotation2 = RapGenius::Annotation.find("2093001") # Fetching directly...

annotation == annotations2
# => true
```

You can search for songs by artist and/or title.

```ruby
results = RapGenius::Song.search("Big Sean Control")
# => [#<RapGenius::Song:0x007fbe4b9195e0
#  @artist="Big Sean (Ft. Jay Electronica & Kendrick Lamar)",
#  @title="Control",
#  @url="http://rapgenius.com/Big-sean-control-lyrics">,
# #<RapGenius::Song:0x007fbe4b920f70
#  @artist="Big Sean (Ft. Jay Electronica & Kendrick Lamar)",

#  @artist="C3",
#  @title=

## Contributing

After the last few contributions, there's one core thing I'd like to add to the gem:

* __Support for *\*Genius*__ - Rap Genius also have other sites on subdomains like [News Genius](http://news.rapgenius.com) and [Poetry Genius](http://poetry.rapgenius.com). These could very easily be supported, since theyre identical in terms of markup.

If you'd like to contribute anything else, go ahead or better still, make an issue and we can talk it over and spec it out! A few quick tips:

* Don't update the version numbers before your pull request - I'll sort that part out for you!
* Make sure you write specs, then run them with `$ bundle exec rake`
* Update this README.md file so I, and users, know how your changes work
